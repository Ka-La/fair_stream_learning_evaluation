This GitHub contains the code for the paper **Realistic Benchmarks for Fair Stream Learning**

The Data Generation Process builds on {https://github.com/DataResponsibly/DataSynthesizer}[DataSynthesizer], with an additional DataManipulator to modify the Bayes Net to introduce new biases.
Scripts to replicate the biases/datasets used in our experiments are avilable; relative paths will need to be adjusted based on where you wish to store generated files.

This repository contains code that implements other algorithms. Implementations in Python are build to be compatible with the river framework.

Due to data constraints, full datastreams can currently not be included in this dataset in the csv-format.
